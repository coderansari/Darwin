  Turn CoinMarketCap market data into a backtestable crypto trading strategy by
  evolving a population of strategy specs with Claude and scoring them on a
  deterministic backtester (risk-adjusted return, drawdown, rule adherence).
  Use when a user wants a trading strategy, a backtest, or a tunable strategy
  spec for BSC / crypto markets — blending indicators (SMA, EMA, RSI, MACD, ROC)
  with the CMC Fear & Greed sentiment signal into entry/exit rules.

# Darwin — Strategy Foundry Skill

A CMC Skill that authors **backtestable trading-strategy specs** from
CoinMarketCap data. Darwin does not just generate one strategy — it *evolves a
population* and returns the champion, with a full backtest report.

## When to use this skill

- "Build me a momentum strategy for BTC/ETH/BNB."
- "Give me a backtestable spec that blends RSI, MACD, and Fear & Greed."
- "Evolve a low-drawdown strategy and show the metrics."
- "Backtest this strategy idea on CoinMarketCap data."

## How to run it

```bash
# Evolve a champion strategy (uses CMC data + Claude if keys are set,
# deterministic synthetic data + operators otherwise):
python -m darwin.cli evolve --universe BTC,ETH,BNB,SOL --generations 8

# Backtest a specific spec file:
python -m darwin.cli backtest --spec strategies/sample-champion.json
```

Outputs land in `runs/<id>/`: `champion.json` (the spec), `report.md` (metrics +
equity curve + lineage), `leaderboard.json`, `history.json`, `equity.csv`.

## The strategy spec format

A spec is plain JSON — readable, reproducible, and executable. The backtester is
the single source of truth for what it means.

```json
{
  "name": "MACD + RSI + Fear&Greed",
  "universe": ["BTC", "ETH", "BNB"],
  "timeframe": "1d",
  "indicators": [
    {"id": "macd",     "type": "MACD",        "source": "close", "fast": 12, "slow": 26, "signal": 9},
    {"id": "macd_sig", "type": "MACD_SIGNAL", "source": "close", "fast": 12, "slow": 26, "signal": 9},
    {"id": "rsi",      "type": "RSI",         "period": 14}
  ],
  "entry": {"all": [
    {"left": "macd", "op": "cross_above", "right": "macd_sig"},
    {"left": "rsi",  "op": "<",  "right": 70},
    {"left": "fgi",  "op": ">",  "right": 30}
  ]},
  "exit": {"any": [
    {"left": "macd", "op": "cross_below", "right": "macd_sig"},
    {"left": "fgi",  "op": ">", "right": 82}
  ]},
  "risk": {
    "max_position_pct": 0.25, "max_open_positions": 3,
    "stop_loss_pct": 0.07, "take_profit_pct": 0.22,
    "max_drawdown_pct": 0.30, "trailing_stop_pct": 0.10
  },
  "sizing": {"type": "equal_weight"},
  "rationale": "enter on MACD momentum confirmed by RSI room and non-fearful sentiment"
}
```

### Vocabulary
- **indicators** — `SMA`, `EMA`, `RSI`, `ROC`, `ATR`, `MACD`, `MACD_SIGNAL`, `MACD_HIST`, `PRICE`.
  MACD types use `fast`/`slow`/`signal`; others use `period`.
- **signals** — `fgi` = CoinMarketCap **Fear & Greed Index** (0–100), usable in any condition.
- **price sources** — `open`, `high`, `low`, `close`, `volume`.
- **operators** — `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`, `cross_above`, `cross_below`.
- **conditions** — `{"all": [...]}`, `{"any": [...]}`, or a leaf `{"left", "op", "right"}`.
- Strategies are **LONG/FLAT**. Entry opens; exit or a risk rule closes.

## How strategies are scored (the fitness rubric)

The backtester is deterministic and lookahead-free, with PancakeSwap-realistic
fees (0.25%) + slippage. Fitness mirrors the BNB-Hack judging rubric:

- **risk-adjusted** — Sortino + Sharpe (clamped to resist flukes)
- **drawdown** — penalized multiplicatively
- **rule adherence** — squared: strategies that fight their own risk rules are crushed
- **turnover** — penalized: over-trading is discouraged

Reported metrics: total return, CAGR, Sharpe, Sortino, **max drawdown**, Calmar,
win rate, trades, exposure, **rule adherence**.

## Authoring tips for the LLM

- Prefer an economically-grounded edge (trend, mean-reversion, momentum, breakout,
  sentiment) over curve-fit noise.
- Always include sane risk rules: a stop, a take-profit, and a `max_drawdown_pct`
  kill-switch.
- Use `fgi` for contrarian or regime filters (e.g. avoid entries in Extreme Fear,
  trim in Extreme Greed).
- Cross `MACD` over `MACD_SIGNAL` for classic momentum entries; confirm with `rsi`.
